====================
Ash's tiny wireframe engine v 0.2
====================

HOW TO GET THE PROGRAM TO RUN:
1: ensure that you are able to run java programs
2: have the program and StdDraw in the same folder/project so they can call each other
(for windows) {
3: create a folder in the directory C:\Program Files (x86) labeled "AshPgms" without the quotes, then create another folder labelled "Wireframes" in that folder
}
(for mac) {
3a: go to the FileCallCheck, and the FileReadToString functions, and change the file directory.
b: make the file directory what you want within the string, but with the slashes inbetween like so /users/name/Wireframes (I don't have a mac so this is just wishful thinking)
}
4: copy the .txt files in the folder you found this in (aside from this one) into Wireframe, inside of Ashpgms

RESOURCES USED:
StdDraw (API for drawing on the screen and double buffering)
W3schools (file system)
GeeksForGeeks (add to array function)
StackOverflow (circle equation)
IBIO (input function)
